# 3D_Environment
This is an OpenGL program that I developed in my Interactive Computer Graphics course at NYU. 

Instructions for running the program:

1. Open up "Assignment 4.sln".
2. Run the program.
3. When you are asked to input a file name, type either "sphere.256" or "sphere.1024" to use those respective text files.
4. When you see the OpenGL program window, press the 'b' key to make the sphere start moving and rolling.

At this point, you can do the following commands:
1. Input 'x' and 'X' to change the camera's x position
2. Input 'y' and 'Y' to change the camera's y position
3. Input 'z' and 'Z' to change the camera's z position
4. Press the right mouse button to stop and start the sphere's animation
5. press the left mouse button to open up a menu. The menu can allow you to enable the sphere to be filled or wireframe, 
change the shading, enable/disable the shadow, change the lighting type, change fog status, and enable/disable fireworks. 
6. Press 'q' to quit the program.
